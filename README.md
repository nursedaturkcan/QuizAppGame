# Quiz App Game
This HTML file contains the basic structure of a Quiz application. The application displays questions to the user along with options and a "Submit" button to evaluate the user's selected answers.<br/>



The JavaScript code stores the data of quiz questions and answers in an array called `quizData`. The `loadQuiz()` function loads the current question and options onto the screen. The `deselectedAnswers()` function clears any unselected options. The `getSelected()` function retrieves the user's selected answer.<br/>

An event listener is added to the `submitBtn` (Submit button) click event. This event listener evaluates the selected answer, increments the score if it is correct, and moves on to the next question. If all questions are answered, it displays the result on the screen and adds a "Try Again" button.<br/>

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used in this project. Quiz questions and answers are stored as an array in the JavaScript code.<br/>
